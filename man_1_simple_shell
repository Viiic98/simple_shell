.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBSimple Shell\fP is a project to understand the behavior of the Real Shell starting with the input data of the user and the error handles until the creation of functions like env and the calling of built-ins like pwd with the PATH and the command execve.

\fBRETURN VALUE\fP

\fBCOMMAND\fP

\fBls\fP 

\fBDescription\fP

\fBThe command ls lists all the files and directories in the path that the user selects in the entry data.\fP

\fBSome Flags\fP

\fBl : Display long format like Unix file type, permissions, number of hard links, owner, group, size, last-modified date and filename.\fP

\fBa : Display all files even hidden or files starting with ".".\fP

\fBt : Sort the list by modification time\fP

\fB1 : Display all the files and directories line by line-1 : Display all the files and directories line by line

\fBExamples\fP

\fBls -lat\fP

\fBls -1\fP

\fBCOMMAND\fP

\fBcd\fP

\fBDescription\fP

\fBThe command cd allows to change from the actual directory to other one. If you put only the command, it redirects to the home directory.\fP

\fBSome Flags\fP

\fB~ : Display the files and directories of the home directory.\fP

\fB. : Display the files and directories of the current directory.\fP

\fB.. : Display the files and directories of the parent directory.\fP

\fB- : Display the files and directories of the variable OLDPWD or previous directory.\fP

\fBExamples\fP

\fBcd ~\fP

\fBcd folder_current_directory\fP

\fBcd -\fP

\fBCOMMAND\fP

\fBcp\fP

\fBDescription\fP

\fBThe command cp allows to copy files to a path and gives them a name or rewrite an existing file.\fP

\fBSome Flags\fP

\fBR or r : copy directories recursively.\fP

\fBp : copy the file and preserve metadata like time of last data modification and time of the last access.\fP

\fBExamples\fP

\fBcp file1 file2 ../parentdirectory\fP

\fBcp file1 file2\fP

\fBCOMMAND\fP

\fBpwd\fP

\fBDescription\fP

\fBThe command pwd allows to display the path of the current directory.\fP

\fBExample\fP

\fBpwd\fP

\fBCOMMAND\fP

\fBecho\fP

\fBDescription\fP

\fBThe command echo allows to display the argument that the user types after the first argument.The command echo allows to display the argument that the user types after the first argument.\fP

\fBExample\fP

\fBecho "Hola"\fP

\fBCOMMAND\fP

\fBenv\fP

\fBDescription\fP

\fBThe command env allows to display all the environment variables of the system.\fP

\fBExample\fP

\fBenv\fP

\fBCOMMAND\fP

\fBrm\fP

\fBDescription\fP

\fBThe command rm allows to delete all the files or directories that the user is available.The command rm allows to delete all the files or directories that the user is available.\fP

\fBSome Flags\fP

\fBr : Remove directories and its contents\fP

\fBi : Ask for every deletion\fP

\fBf : Force every deletion without asking\fP

\fBExamples\fP

\fBrm -rf directory_with_files\fP

\fBrm file1\fP

\fBrm file1 file2 file3\fP

\fBCOMMAND\fP

\fBexit\fP

\fBDescription\fP

\fBThe command exit allows to finish the execution of the Simple Shell. If the exit in the function has an argument, which must be an integer, the command must finish the program and then return to the normal shell and the value of "echo $?" must be an integer between 0 and 255. If the value of exit status is greater than 255, it must divide the value in 256 and get the integer value of the division, multiply by 256 and this value must be substracted from the status value.\fP

\fBExample\fP

\fBexit\fP

\fBexit 98\fP

\fBexit 300\fP

\fB**SHELL MODES**\fP

\fBINTERACTIVE MODE\fP

\fBThe interactive mode is the way that the shell receives the commands in first plain. First, you have to run the compilated file and then type the command line.\fP

\fBNON-INTERACTIVE\fP

\fBThe non-interactive mode is the way that the shell receives the commands in second plain. Directly, you have to type the command that you want to execute, the character pipe "|" and then the name of the compilated file of the simple shell.\fP
